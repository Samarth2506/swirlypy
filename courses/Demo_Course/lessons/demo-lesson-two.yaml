  Output: "Welcome to the second lesson in the demo! Let's get started."

- Category: command
  Output: Can you create a variable x with value 42?
  Answer: x = 42
  Hint: Type x = 42 at the prompt

  Output: "Great! Next, we understand the structure \
    of an if loop in Python. \
    If loops have the following structure:\nif some_condition:\
    \n  do_action1\nelse:\n  do_action2"

- Category: GetValue
  Output: >
    Can you print 'positive' or 'negative' based on x's value? 
    Make sure to follow the indentation in the if-loop structure!
    Remember, to execute multiple lines in Swirlypy, keep pressing
    enter to go to the next line. Hit enter twice to submit!
  # Answer: >
  #   if x>0: 
  #     print('positive')
  #   else:
  #     print('negative')
  value: 'positive' 
  Hint: >
    Try any variation of an if-loop to check x's value. Make sure
    to take care of the indentation with a tab as shown in the sample
    structure above.

  Output: "Great! Next, we understand the structure \
    of a for loop in Python. \
    For loops have the following structure:\nfor i in some_list(or string):\
    \n  do_action1 with i"

  Output: >
     We have pre-loaded a list, 'words' for you.
     If you wanted to iterate and print over every element in
     words, you would do something like for w in words: print(w).
     Ensure correct indentation for your answer!
  value: "cat\nwindow\ndefenestrate"
  Hint: "Type for w in words:\n     print(i) at the prompt"


- Category: script
  Output: Let's write our first function in Python! At the prompt, enter 'open' (in quotes) to open the 
    the script. Your task is to create a function called boring function that returns the string random. 
    Good luck!
  user_script: boring_function
  correct_script: boring_function_correct
  test_cases: custom_tests_1
  hint: 'Something was wrong. Try again!'

- Category: text
  Output: "Brilliant! Looks like your script returned the right output and passed all tests!\
    That is the end of the demo course. Good luck learning!"
