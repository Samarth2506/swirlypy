    Welcome to the first lesson in this demo course! This is
    an example of a text question type!

- Category: command
  Output: >
    The prompt, >>>, below indicates that you 
    should enter a Python command. This is an example of a command
    question. Enter print('Hello, world!').
  Answer: print('Hello, world!')
  Hint: Oops! Can you type print('Hello, world!') and hit the Enter key.

    The equal sign is used to assign a value to a 
    variable. Can you assign the variable 'width' a value of 20 
    using the equals sign? You will see syntax like spaces and
    single versus double quotes do not matter.
  Answer: width = 20
  Hint: "Type width = 20 at the prompt"

- Category: command
  Output: >
    Anything you type is recorded by Swirlypy and can be consequetly
    used in the next question. Since you created the variable width,
    its available through the next questions. Can you print width?
  Answer: print(width)
  Hint: "Type print(width) at the prompt"

    But what if you wanted a dataset for the user to practice with? You simply add it
    to the initialize lesson script. The variables and data are then available for you
    to create lessons and for the user to practice on! Let's see how that is done.

- Category: command
  Output: "The iris dataset has already been loaded for you. To check, we will print the first 5 rows of the dataset using the head comand. Enter iris_data.head()"
  Answer: iris_data.head()
  Hint: "Type iris_data.head() and hit the Enter key."

- Category: command
  Output: You can make changes to the data and these changes are also propagated through
    the lesson. For example, can you delete a column? Delete the 'petal_length' column in iris_data!
  Answer: iris_data.drop("petal_length", axis=1, inplace=True)
  Hint: "Use the .drop method on the iris dataframe. Make sure to set inplace to true!"

- Category: command
  Output: Well done! Can you print the first 5 rows of iris data to confirm your changes?
  Answer: iris_data.head()
  Hint: "Type iris_data.head() and hit the Enter key."

- Category: command
  Output: "Nice! Can you calculate the frequency of classes using the value_counts() method? Be sure\
    to convert it to a dataframe. Pandas was already imported as pd in initialize lesson! "
  Answer: plot_data = m.pd.DataFrame(iris_data['species'].value_counts())
  Hint: "Type iris_data['species'].value_counts() and hit the Enter key."

- Category: command
  Output: "You can also make explicit imports! Import pyplot from Matplotlib as plt."
  Answer: import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
  Hint: "Type iris_data['species'].value_counts() and hit the Enter key."

- Category: command
  Output: "Nice! Now we are doing to try our hand at plotting! Use Pandas to plot and assign the plot\
     to the variable ax."
  Answer: ax = plot_data[['species']].plot(kind='bar',legend=True) 
  Hint: "Type ax = plot_data[['species']].plot(kind='bar',legend=True) and hit the Enter key."

- Category: command
  Output: "Now show the plot with plt.show()"
  Answer: plt.show()
  Hint: "Type plt.show() and hit the Enter key."

- Category: multiplechoice
  Output: "You can also have multiple choice questions in Swirlypy! If you wanted the
     output, Jinkies!, which of the following commands should you type?"
  Choices:
    - print('Jinkies!')
    - print('Jinkies')
    - print('Scooby-dooby-do, where are you?')
    - print('If it weren't for those meddling kids!')
  Answer: print('Jinkies!')
  Hint: "Look for the command, print, and the word, 'Jinkies!' (with an !)"

- Category: text
  Output: "Great going! You have completed the first lesson in the demo showing some features of Swirlypy.\
     Move on to the second lesson to tackle slightly more completed questions."
