  Output: "Welcome to the first lesson on Python programming! \
    We are going to cover some basics of Python to get you started \
    with an informal introduction. Lets get started!"

- Category: command
  Output: "We will first learn to use Python as a calculator. Try \
    calculating 2+2 directly at the Python console"
  Answer: 2 + 2
  Hint: "Type 2+2 at the prompt"

- Category: text
  Output: "Now that you know how that Python can be used as a \
    calculator, we will explore various division options in Python. \
    A quick refresher before move on. Remember that integer numbers \
    (such as 1) have type 'int' while ones with a fractional part \
    (such as 1.2) have type 'float'."

- Category: command
  Output: "The division operator '/' always returns a float. Can you divide \
    17 by 3 using the operator?"
  Answer: 17/3
  Hint: "Type 17/3 at the prompt"

- Category: command
  Output: "Nice! What if you wanted the closest integer division possible? \
    Then we use the '//' operator. This is also called floor division. \
    Can you try floor division of 17 by 3?"
  Answer: 17//3
  Hint: "Type 17//3 at the prompt. You are almost there!"

- Category: command
  Output: "Well done! What if you were interested in the remainder \
    of the operation? Then we use the '%' operator! Can you get the \
    remainder when 17 is divided by 3?"
  Answer: 17%3
  Hint: "Type 17%3 at the prompt"

- Category: command
  Output: "Great! Let's move on. To multiply numbers, we use the '*' \
    operator in Python. Can you multiple 5 and 3?"
  Answer: 5*3
  Hint: "Type 5*3 at the prompt"

- Category: command
  Output: "Next, to calculate powers, the '**' operator is used. \
    Can you calculate the square of 5?"
  Answer: 5**2
  Hint: "Type 5**2 at the prompt"

- Category: command
  Output: "The equal sign is used to assign a value to a \
  variable. Can you assign the variable 'width' a value of 20 \
  using the equals sign?"
  Answer: width = 20
  Hint: "Type width = 20 at the prompt"

- Category: command
  Output: "Well done! Can you assign the variable 'height' \
    the result of 5 multiplied by 9? "
  Answer: height = 5*9
  Hint: "Type height = 5*9 at the prompt"

- Category: command
  Output: "Now that you have assigned values to 'height' and 'width', \
    you can use the variables directly for subsequent computations, \
    Can you multiple width by height?"
  Answer: width*height
  Hint: "Type width*height at the prompt"

- Category: command
  Output: "Now let's use the previous result, the area for other \
    calculations. Notice that we have not assigned product of width \
    and height to a variable. In Python, the last computation is stored \
    the variable '_'. Can you add 5 to the area using the '_' variable?"
  Answer: _ + 5
  Hint: "Type _ + 5 at the prompt"

- Category: command
  Output: "You can continue computing using this method! Just ensure \
  the variable '_' is explicitly overwritten by you. However, \
  if a variable is not 'defined'(assigned a value), \
      Python will throw an error. Try print(n)"
  Answer: print(n)
  Hint: "Type print(n) at the prompt"

- Category: text
  Output: "You see! Ensure new variables are defined before using them."

- Category: text
  Output: "That brings us to the end of this lesson! You can continue \
  on to the next lesson in the course. Thank you!"
