    In this lesson, we will learn about 
    flow control statements in Python

- Category: command
  Output: Set x's value to 42
  Answer: x = 42
  Hint: Type x = 42 at the prompt

- Category: command
  Output: check the value for x by printing x
  Answer: print(x)
  Hint: "Type print(x) at the prompt"

  Output: "Great! Next, we understand the structure \
    of an if loop in Python. \
    If loops have the following structure:\nif some_condition:\
    \n  do_action1\nelse:\n  do_action2"

- Category: GetValue
  Output: >
    Can you print 'positive' or 'negative' based on x's value? 
    Make sure to follow the indentation in the if-loop structure!
    Remember, to execute multiple lines in Swirlypy, keep pressing
    enter to go to the next line. Hit enter twice to submit!
  # Answer: >
  #   if x>0: 
  #     print('positive')
  #   else:
  #     print('negative')
  value: 'positive' 
  Hint: >
    Try any variation of an if-loop to check x's value. Make sure
    to take care of the indentation with a tab as shown in the sample
    structure above.

  Output: Great going! We will now understand the For loop in
    Python. Pythonâ€™s for statement iterates over the items of any
    sequence (a list or a string), in the order that they
    appear in the sequence.

  Output: "Great! Next, we understand the structure \
    of a for loop in Python. \
    For loops have the following structure:\nfor i in some_list(or string):\
    \n  do_action1 with i"

     We have pre-loaded a list, 'words' for you.
     If you wanted to iterate and print over every element in
     words, you would do something like for w in words: print(w).
     Ensure correct indentation for your answer!
  value: "cat\nwindow\ndefenestrate"
  Hint: "Type for w in words:\n     print(i) at the prompt"

    If you do need to iterate over a sequence of numbers,
    the built-in function range() comes in handy. It generates
    arithmetic progressions.

- Category: GetValue
  Output: For example, if you wanted to print numbers from 0 to 4,
    you would iterate through 'i' (or any other variable) through
    range(5) with a foor loop. The given end point is never part
    of the generated sequence. Can you print numbers 0 to 4 using
    range() and a for loop?
  value: "0\n1\n2\n3\n4"
  Hint: "Type for i in range(5)\n print(i) at the prompt"
  
- Category: GetValue
  Output: It is possible to let the range start at another number,
    or to specify a different increment. Just remember that the
    start number is included in the sequence while the end number
    is excluded. The increment is the the third argument in the
    range function. Can print increments of 2 starting from 2 to 12?
  value: "2\n4\n6\n8\n10\n12"
  Hint: "Type for i in range(2,13,2)\n print(i) at the prompt.
    Remember, the last number is not included so you need 13 as the
    ending digit. Also, the third argument is 2 as you need increments
    of 2!"
